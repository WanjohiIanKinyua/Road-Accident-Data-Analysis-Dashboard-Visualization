✅ Task 3 Summary: Road Accident Data Analysis & Dashboard Visualization
In Task 3, I conducted an in-depth analysis of road accident data with the goal of identifying high-risk locations, uncovering common causes, and visualizing trends to support data-driven safety improvements.

🔍 What I Did:
Cleaned and prepared a large dataset containing over 300,000 accident records.
Extracted meaningful time-based insights by generating new columns (e.g., Year, Month, Hour, DayOfWeek).
Identified top 10 accident-prone districts and analyzed severity distribution across various locations.
Explored how conditions like weather, road type, and junction control influence accident severity.
Exported the cleaned dataset and developed a fully interactive dashboard in Excel, featuring:
PivotTables and charts for accident trends
Filters for dynamic exploration by year, severity, day, and more
High-risk location bar charts and monthly trend line graphs

🛠 Tools Used:
Python (Jupyter Notebook): For data cleaning, transformation, and exporting
Excel: For interactive dashboard creation

📈 Skills Gained:
Data cleaning and preprocessing (pandas)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Time-series trend analysis
Dashboard design and storytelling in Excel
